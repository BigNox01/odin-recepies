<ul>
    <p><h2>Ingridients</h2></p>
    <li><h3>Meat</h3></li>
    <p>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian 
        sausage and lean ground beef.</p>
        <li><h3> Onion and garlic</h3></li>
        <p>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked 
            with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>
            <li><h3>Tomato products</h3></li>
            <p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, 
                two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
            </p>
                <li><h3>Sugar</h3></li>
                <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and 
                    enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>
                    <li><h3>Spices and seasonings: </h3></li>
                    <p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, 
                        dried basil leaves, 
                        salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
                        <li><h3>Lasagna noodles</h3></li>
                        <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
                        <li><h3>Cheeses</h3></li>
                        <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, 
                            and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
                          <li><h3>Egg</h3></li>  
                          <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
</ul>
<h2>How to make it</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
        <p> Preheat the oven to 350F.</p>
        <li><h3>step2</h3></li>
        <p> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook the ground beef, stirring to crumble, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Drain off the fat.
        </p>
        <li><h3>step3</h3></li>
        <p>
            To the skillet of ground beef, 
            add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 
            Italian seasoning, salt, 
            black pepper, 
            red pepper flakes, and garlic powder. Simmer for 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <li><h3>step4</h3></li>
        <p>
            Place half of noodles in a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish, 
            slightly overlapping lengthwise edges. 
            Spoon one-third of the meat mixture over the noodles; 
            add half of the shredded mozzarella, ricotta or cottage cheese, 
            and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat layers, and spoon on the remaining meat mixture. 
            Arrange the mozzarella slices on top. 
            Cover the baking dish with foil. Bake at 350F for 35 to 45 minutes. 
            Remove the foil, and continue to bake for an additional 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <li><h3>step5</h3></li>
        <p>
            Let the finished dish rest for 10 minutes before serving. 
            Top with chopped parsley, if desired.
        </p>
